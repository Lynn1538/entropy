	<p><font face="Cursive" size="3pt">As subtle as possible, you slip within the open front gates of the Cathedral, shuffling against the concrete road before finally making it within the gardens. While you're still safe and out of sight, you make it to the front doors of large establishment, but then you stop. For a minute, a tinge of weariness floods your mind, and quickly, you look behind you to be sure.

		<strong>"What happens if I get caught?"</strong> You think to yourself. <strong>"should I just go back?"</strong> All the while, your hand still presses against the door.</p><hr>
