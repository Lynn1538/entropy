	<p><font face="Cursive" size="3pt">You decide to stay up a while longer, after all it's not too late to sleep yet. While awake, you think about what has happened throughout your day, and upon further contemplation, you start to think about your past memories. Past thoughts and choices, wondering what life would be if you lived somewhere else...If you met other people, if you felt happy over what you're given now. A strange, unsettling feeling hits your throat, trailing down to your stomach. While you're not very vocal about your stress, let alone your day, you would like a chance in change. Unfortunately, there isn't much to do to keep yourself completely awake.</font></p>
