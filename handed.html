	<p><font face="Cursive" size="3pt">It was best to simply accept the fact that you were in the wrong to enter the person's home. Meekly, you hold your hands out, just lightly above your shoulders, however lightly taking a few steps back. <strong>"I'm sorry!"</strong> You nervously murmured, looking over at the door, you didn't even bother to give them eye contact yet! <strong>"I saw your gate open, and...I was merely curious to look inside, I'll take my leave, I promise!"</strong></font></p>

	<p><font face="Cursive" size="3pt">"Now now..." it speaks, giving a soft laugh. "There is no need to be afraid of stumbling into the doors of deliverance...but please, at least look me in the eyes when you apologize." It teased you, it's jests were rather strange for such a spur of the moment, and thus, you decide to take a look at the person you were apologizing to...</font></p>

		<p><font face="Cursive" size="3pt">You jump, startled at the person in front of you. Was it safe to call it a person? The figure was adrongynous at best, with a black cloak covering the entirelty of its body, a shovel strapped on it's back, and half of their face was adorned in a gas mask, antlers poking out from it's hood. To say the least...the body was entirely eccetric, and perhaps frightening. However, the voice behind the mask, was merely gentle.</font></p>

		<p><font face="Cursive" size="3pt">"Oh! I'm sorry..." It speaks, in a soft drawl, putting away his gardening tools and offering you a seat. "It's been so long since I've had a guest enter my humble home...are you lost?"</font></p>
