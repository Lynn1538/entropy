	<p><font face="Cursive" size="3pt">"My my..." A faint laugh was heard as the figure approached you from it's shoveling from earlier. "You know, the gate was open, you could've always moved in..."</font></p>

		<p><font face="Cursive" size="3pt">You jump, startled at the person in front of you. Was it safe to call it a person? The figure was adrongynous at best, with a black cloak covering the entirelty of its body, a shovel strapped on it's back, and half of their face was adorned in a gas mask, antlers poking out from it's hood. To say the least...the body was entirely eccetric, and perhaps frightening. However, the voice behind the mask, was merely gentle.</font></p>

		<p><font face="Cursive" size="3pt">"Oh! I'm sorry..." Slowly, it's gloved hands grasp against the gate, sliding it open all the way for you to walk in, and steps back for extra space. "It's been so long since I've had a guest enter my humble home...are you lost?"</font></p>
