	<p><font face="Cursive" size="3pt">Your moral conscious gets to you, and you believe that now's not in the right. With a small exhale, you take a step back from the Cathedral doors, and with a swift pivet, you turn the other way, deciding that it's just best to go back-</font></p>

		<p><font face="Cursive" size="3pt">"...Excuse me."</font></p>

		<p><font face="Cursive" size="3pt">You jump, startled at the person in front of you. Was it safe to call it a person? The figure was adrongynous at best, with a black cloak covering the entirelty of its body, a shovel strapped on it's back, and half of their face was adorned in a gas mask, antlers poking out from it's hood. To say the least...the body was entirely eccetric, and perhaps frightening. However, the voice behind the mask, was merely gentle.</font></p>

		<p><font face="Cursive" size="3pt">"Oh! I'm sorry..." It speaks, in a soft drawl, reaching out for your hand. "It's been so long since I've had a guest enter my humble home...are you lost?"</font></p>
