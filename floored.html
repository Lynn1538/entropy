	<p><font face="Cursive" size="3pt">Quickly, you try to run away from the one that lived inside the Cathreal doors, however in a rush of adrenaline and carelessness, your foot knocks against the legs of the chairs, causing you to tumble and fall on the hard floors. Ouch. Immediately, you begin to contemplate how you're going to make it out of here, only for a hand to grasp against your shoulder.</font></p>

	<p><font face="Cursive" size="3pt">"Oh dear, are you alright?" Did...did you hear that right? Concern? After you just broke into their house? "That was quite a fall, let me help you up." Quickly, you turn to look over at the person who reached for your shoulder...</font></p>

	<p><font face="Cursive" size="3pt">You jump, startled at the person in front of you. Was it safe to call it a person? The figure was adrongynous at best, with a black cloak covering the entirelty of its body, a shovel strapped on it's back, and half of their face was adorned in a gas mask, antlers poking out from it's hood. To say the least...the body was entirely eccetric, and perhaps frightening. However, the voice behind the mask, was merely gentle.</font></p>

		<p><font face="Cursive" size="3pt">"Oh! I'm sorry..." It speaks, in a soft drawl, before softly holding your hand and bringing you back to your feet in a single heave. Under the mask, the other laughs. "It's been so long since I've had a guest enter my humble home...are you lost?"</font></p>
